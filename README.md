# The Rills 

I've decied to build The Rills a site to help with their promotion, gigs and merchandise. Prior to coding, I worked in the music industry and feel my knowledge can be applied positively for this project. 

# UX 

This website is for an Indie band called **The Rills**. The Rills are a relatively new band so we can assume the majority of their fans will be of Scoial Media age. 
As a musician and tech user, I've noticed how the large majority of music based websites feel very outdated and linear. Which is perculiar considering the target user. 

Nonetheless, my conceptual idea to help resolve this issue hinges on the _nature_ in which social media is consumed. Instead of a traditional landing page, I felt one that invites navigation would be far more intuiative and natural. The ease in which technology can be consumed determines the level of user engagement. A mix of Dashboard and Hub and Spoke structure should compliment this design.

###### ***Wireframe model aligned with this concept*** 
This intuative layout not only keeps the user engaged, it prompts the user to move down through the homepage. This will help highlight key areas that the band want to focus on. For The Rills, it will help promote their new gigs and merchandise more effectively. Each section can be simple and bold with little information encouraging the user to interact and naviate through the content.

Technology needs to reflect the product. With music being the subject for this product, some components of the site need be dynamic and lively. 

I've highlighted **four** generally static features that need changing:

1. Replace the tab section, usually top right of the landing page, with a burger icon. A menu page that opens and collapses from the left side. Indicated by three hased lines. This will also help to keep the site focused.
2. Instead of a singular hero image to greet the user, make a simple image carousel showing off live gigs, press shots and other important aspects of the band.
3. Replace the standard scroll bar with one that appears when the user is scrolling.
4. Make a thin socials nav bar below the carousel to help convert users into followers.

With this style implemented, adding boxed sections is far easier. These sections can be floating and don't need to be tabbed. Keeping the site current with a more newsfeed type feel.

# Features

- Social media strip bar at the top rather than stuck at the bottom. This encourages and makes it easier for the user to follow the band. In this age, social media is essential in the music industry and as a product helps drive other sales.

- A collapsable section menu. Using a burger icon to hide navbar tabs allows the user to digest everything on the landing page. It keeps them focused on the important content and puts more ernest on the social media design.

- Black and white monochromatic color style to match the band logo and overall aesthtic. Helps the user to feel secure and in the right place. Image is extremely important for artists so the colour design needs to make sense. I want the site to become another powerful tool to help grow their community.

- Direct subscribe button on the youtube section. A similar feature to the social media navbar but will help to keep user on the page and not directed away. More time spent on the site means more merch and gig sales should occur.

- Standard email sign up form to help gather valuable data. Gives the user an opportuinty to signup for exclusive content, merch and song releases.

- Live gigs sction where user can directly buy tickets. This will be immediately under the socials bar purely to reflect UX. The most important features are placed higher in the pecking order.

### Features left to implement 

- Unable to implement at this stage of my learning but eventually id like to make an account/login section. With this feature we could make a community hub for people to share stories, photos, videos and generally chat with The Rills community. Will help keep users engaged, wanting to come check out the site and feel connected with the band.
